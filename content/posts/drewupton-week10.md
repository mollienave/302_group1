This week, I worked on both the group website and the community partner project. For the group website, I began dissecting the options that our music plugin provides. I created a test album with random variables and a random cover to better familiarize myself with the plugin. This would relate to "I can identify and employ technologies related to content management," as the plugin will certainly help us fimalize our group website by adding the option for users to upload music. On the community partner project, I finalized both the header and the footer, getting as close to the original as i could. I am still trying to add icons to the footer, rather than just using "address" and other terms.
