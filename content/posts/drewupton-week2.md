This week, I collaborated with my team to decide upon a group contract. While this contract may change slightly, it is well organized and I believe we can accomplish everything in a timely manner. In Canvas, I watched over a couple of interviews and a video discussing the roles on the first Star Wars movie. I also read and annotated an article from Deane Barker discussing the umbrella that is Content Management. Overall, I progressed towards my understanding of CMS.
