This week, I set up Tasks on Microsoft Teams with my group. This will allow us to divide and conquer any assignments or responsibilities that come our way by splitting things up, assigning roles, and setting deadlines for each role, among other things. This is another step towards managing content using established workflows, which is one of our "I Can" statements. As a class, we established possible workflows for the two website projects that we will be working on this semester.
