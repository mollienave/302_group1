This week, I explored Github and Hugo with my group. We messed around with different folders and attempted to edit the menu tabs. I wasnt familiar with "go" as a programming language, so I did some research on w3schools to better educate myself on the language. This works directly in conjunction with our "I Can" statements. More specifically, "I can find and use resources for self-directed learning."
