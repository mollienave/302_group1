This week, I learned more about and worked with WordPress. My group and I tried to set up our WordPress site using XAMPP, but to no avail. Alternatively, we also tried to set up our WordPress site using MAMP, but that also resulted in issues, such as the site not showing up correctly on other members computers. To make an attempt at troubleshooting, I did research on some other websites to try and figure out the root of my issue. This relates to our "I Can" statement, that being "I can find and use resources for self-directed learning." We still have issues to iron out, but hopefully we can figure those out in week 7.
