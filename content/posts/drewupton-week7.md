This week, I continued work on our group website. Unfortunately, while we werent able to get our server to fully work, we brainstormed some logo ideas and worked on a logo in Canva. Additionally, I used outside resources for self directed learning, using YouTube to research plugins in for WordPress for the community project. The group project could be going better, but I believe a solution will come soon.
