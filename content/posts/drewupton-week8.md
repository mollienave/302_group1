This week, I was recovering from a short hiatus away from classes due to some personal events. On Friday, I met with my team for the community partner project in class to regroup and see where we were at, what has been done, and what we need to do. I messed around a bit more with the wordpress site to get a better feel for the software. I worked on the footer a bit, trying to get the formatting as close to the original as possible, meaning I was able to identify and employ technologies related to content management (Wordpress). On wednesday I hope to meet with my group for this project and make some more progress, on top of the great progress that has been mde thus far.
