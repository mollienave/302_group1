This week, I continued work on both the community partner project and the group website project. With the community partner project, I attempted to format both the header and the footer, which is a larger challenge tham previously expected. My work this week related to "I Can" find and use resources for self-directed learning, as I used multiple forums and other sources of information to figure out the specifics of WordPress header/footer formatting. For the group website project, I worked on the playlists page further to try and set up curated playlists for users.
