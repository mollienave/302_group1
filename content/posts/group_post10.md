This week our group was able to continue updating our website. We created our music store page this week and began to come up with a way to organize the music store. We decided to organize the music store by genre so that it would be easier for consumers to find the type of music they are looking for. We also created a footer for our website this week that is permanent on every page. We are still working on creating playlists and uploading music to the site and are hoping to start on that this week.
