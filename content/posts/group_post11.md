This week my group continued to make progress on our site. We were able to make individual pages for some songs on the site so that the page told users the title of the song, the album it was from, and the genre it belonged to. The pages also include an embedded YouTube video so that users can stream the music directly from our site. We were also able to continue updating our store page and started to categorize the songs on the site by genre. We are still working on the curated playlist page as well as adding more individual songs to the site.
