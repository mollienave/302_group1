This week we were able to work together to create a plan for our group project. This consisted of all of the tasks that we all needed to complete to get the website up and running, as well as looking professional. We decided that we didnâ€™t want to split the work up based on back end and front end experience because we wanted to get a wide range of skills during this class. So instead we will all pick and choose from each category what we wanted to work on to finish the website. We were able to set up the add-on to Microsoft teams that allows us to keep track of tasks that people have completed.
