For this week, our group was not very successful in getting our website to progress. We could still not access our WordPress site after having tried MAMP and XAMP. However, our group did get to start working on designing our logo using Canva and was able to start looking at eCommerce WordPress themes and plugins available that would let us upload audio files to the site.
