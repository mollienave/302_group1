This week our group made significant progress on our site! We were all able to access the site now that it is not self-hosted and were able to actually start working! We were able to pick a theme and start customizing it to fit our site as well as adding pages, such as an ‘About Us” page. We are still working on figuring out the plugins for uploading music and the details for creators building their own profiles!
