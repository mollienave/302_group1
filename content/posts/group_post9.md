This week our group continued to work on our site! We were able to add more music to our site and start building the curated playlist page and we currently have a hip-hop playlist and a Raincoatâ€™s greatest hits playlist and are planning to add more music. We also started adding content to our homepage. Our goal is to create a homepage that explains the mission of RainCoat music and the services it offers. Our site is still a work in progress, as we are continuing to add music and make changes, but we are very excited about our progress!
