This week we were able to work together on the group project and create our contact. While creating our contract, we were able to discuss our different skills and how they could contribute to the project. One example of this is that some members of our group have extensive experience in markdown and were able to upload our group contract to our Hugo site and format it using markdown. We also discussed how several of us had photoshop experience and could work together to make the logo and various other branding materials for our WordPress site.
