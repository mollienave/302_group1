This week, our group worked with our WordPress server and tried to get it up and running so we would all have access. Unfortunately, we weren't able to get a reliable connection set up this week. We attempted to use XAMPP, but were unsuccessful in our efforts. We later tried to use MAMP instead, but still ran into issues that prevented us from working on our site, such as the site looking different on other member's computers. Hopefully, we can get our site to work and set up a reliable connection to a server this next week.
