This week I learned a lot about website creation and tools to use to help with that. I can find and use resources for self-directed learning is something I hit on the most this week. I learned that Microsoft teams is quite useful and also made my first account on Github. Learned about how the class will be set up, and some cool projects we will be working on throughout this class. I had never heard of Hugo and I am very excited to get to use it and have that under my belt. I also have realized I may be more useful on the front end of things for my group.
