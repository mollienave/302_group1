This week I learned that I can find and use resources for self-directed learning. The website is coming together and we are busy learning new options that we can incorperate into our website. This week I have found inspiration from different websites and looked up some options we can do these things with using wordpress. This week it has been more polishing and finding new things we can use to add the ideas we have come up with.
