This week I learned that I can manage manage content using established workflows. I have been sorting through our content that we have thus far and looked at what we might still need. Having an established workflow and group dynamic is ideal and we have just that. Each person expressed what they wanted for this project and now we are in the midst of bringing it to life. Establishing workflows for your group is always something you should do for seamless teamwork. I was able to talk with our group and see where we are at while we add small adjustments to our final product.
