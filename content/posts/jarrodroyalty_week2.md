This week I learned what exactly it takes to create an idea for a website that gives purpose. This week I can identify and employ technologies related to content management. This includes figuring out ideas to incorperate a store front within our website, this requires something like shopify. Another thing we talked about was adding spotify and embedding it right into the website interface, this will require so back end work but I think it is more than possible. This week was about finding resources to support our base idea for the project, we did just that.
