This week I was able to put together a couple pages on the website with the group, I also was working on a layout for the website we might be able to use. Essentially giving us 3 main tabs to add for our website, Music, Home, and Submit a song. On top of that we were inching towards also adding a shopify extentions for our website and adding a storefront to purchase CDs.
