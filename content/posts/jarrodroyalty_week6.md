This week I was able to talk with my team and figure out the best way to get into the wordpress website, I was able to help trouble shoot issues we were having with XAAMP and ZAAMP. After long and hard debugging we fixed the glitch that we had caused and all of us were able to get into the website. I have compiled a list of music to add to the website and figured out couple options for plugins we might use with our website. These include shopify, wpforms, and youtube video player embedding.
