This week we ran upon issues getting our wordpress site to work after a bug stumped us last week. We were able to fix the issue on one persons computer, now we are back to square one and getting it to work with everyones computers. We started looking into other stuff after we failed at getting into the site such as themes and layout designs. I have rounded up some images to use for the website related to our project.
