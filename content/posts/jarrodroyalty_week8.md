This week we figured out how to install plugins and add themes to our new and improved site! I started with embedding the youtube music video we wanted to implement into the site. Also found a plugin to take care of the shop and the music as well as a bunch of other things we might need down the line. The next thing I plan to work on is implementing colors and pictures into the page.
