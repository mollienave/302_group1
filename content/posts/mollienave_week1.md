This week I learned how to use Hugo and Github in order to post on my group’s Hugo site, which is part of the I can identify and employ technologies related to content management. I was able to help set up my group’s Hugo site and use Github to make my first post and learned how Github and Hugo work together to do content management on the web. My team and I also started establishing workflows, as we talked about who is more interested in doing the front end or back end side of content, which relates to the I can manage content using established workflows.
