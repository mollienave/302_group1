This week I was able to find and use resources for self-directed learning. This week while working on the community project, I was able to learn from others in my class. I was able to borrow code from another group to use on the roofing page and ask my classmates around me how to make a picture a header. I was also able to use google to continue to research gallery plugins for Wordpress.
