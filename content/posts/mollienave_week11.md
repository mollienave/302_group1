This week I was able to find and use resources for self-directed learning. While working on the community partner project this week, I was able to ask questions and learn from those around me. I teamed up with some of my classmates to help format content on the DayBreak site so that all text was even and everyoneâ€™s page looked the same. Through working with my classmates, I was able to use Google and ask questions to learn about widgets and different other techniques to center text and format blocks in WordPress.
