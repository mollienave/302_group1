This week I was able to identify and define key concepts in content management. From the readings, interview, and this weekâ€™s lecture I was able to learn about how important audiences are for content creators and how the audience varies based on what content you are creating and who you are creating it for. Comic creators have a very specific audience while the College of Communication and Information has a broader audience that varies based on the content they are creating. I was also able to gain more information about content and monetization, as I learned that content must be given value by the audience and that not every piece of content has inherent value.
