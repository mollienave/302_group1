This week I learned a lot about workflows in teams. My group and I started discussing what tasks needed to be done to make our site look and work at its absolute best. My group also started dividing tasks and discussing what different skills everyone had and I was able to add tasks to our Microsoft Teams group planner. I was also able to contribute to the class discussion on how to form teams for our community partner projects and help establish workflows for those projects.
