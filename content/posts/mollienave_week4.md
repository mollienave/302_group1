This week I was able to identify and employee technologies related to content management. I was able to play around with Github and was able to successfully upload another page to my groupâ€™s Hugo website. I also got the opportunity to learn more about the organization of Hugo and Github as I learned how to make a new folder within Github. I was also able to log in to WordPress for the community partner project and learn about the layout of WordPress and the different editing options it has.
