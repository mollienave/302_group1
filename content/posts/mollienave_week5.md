This week I was able to employ technologies related to content management. This week I was able to work with WordPress as I was able to download WordPress to my computer and access the WordPress site for the community group project. This allowed me to be able to learn more about WordPress and get experience with the different templates and content layouts of WordPress. I was able to learn a lot about WordPress this week and am excited to continue using it!
