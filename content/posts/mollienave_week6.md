This week I was able to employ technologies related to content management. This week I was able to help my group set up our WordPress site on a local server. After trying XAMP on another group member’s computer and not getting WordPress to connect, I was then able to try MAMP on my computer. I was able to get WordPress installed on my computer and learned how to pull up MAMP on my computer. My group was able to pull up the WordPress site but was not able to log in to edit, so one of my group’s main tasks to accomplish this week will be connecting to the WordPress site.
