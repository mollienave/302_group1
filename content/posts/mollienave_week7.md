This week I was able to find and use resources for self-directed learning. This week was a lot of trial and error in getting WordPress to work for both projects and I was able to use Google to answer a lot of my questions about WordPress. I was able to Google and research the best gallery plugins for the community WordPress project and hope to implement those plugins in class on Friday.
