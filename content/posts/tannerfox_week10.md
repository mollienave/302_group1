This week i found and used resources for self-directed learning, I have watched multiple youtube videos to see what other people have done in order to create a similiar page, although i have seen a lot of people using plugins to achieve this i did not want to copy that. So instead i have started to code in HTML which wordpress is able to incorporate to be able to create a working template for users to use, so far i have completed half of the code but have some errors that stop it from working.
