This week i was able to identify and empoly technologies related to content management, i have been working on the form for the "contact Us" page on our wordpress website. I have been doing a lot of reserach trying to help me figure out what is wrong with the HTML code that i have already implemeted, the page is some what working, as far as the response boxes, however i have not been able to get the sumbit feature to work. I have been using multiple websites that break down the code to try and figure out what is wrong but have had no luck.
