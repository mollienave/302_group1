This week i was able to identify and define key concepts in content management, this was through begining to brainstorm ideas for what we want to be on our wordpress website and how the layout should be. I was able to asist with creating the group contract for how we are going to be grading ourselves, through this we determined what exactly we want the website to have and to do. We came up with the idea of having a spotify type music streaming website, i also threw out the idea of having song suggestions based on what the user has recently listened too, this would be done through importing the users cookies into the website to show what they had listened too.
