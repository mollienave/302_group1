This week i was able to identify and employ technologies related to content management by adding on the plugin-in to our microsoft teams group that allows us to share our logo designs from photoshop through the adobe cloud. This will give us a centralized location to share this content so that it is concurent on all of our computers. I was also able to find and use resources for self-directed learning, this was done by creating a temporary wordpress account so that i can see what all can be done for our project, this will assit me to better know what tasks need to be completed while working on the project as well as what steps need to be taken to achieve the components we want on the website.
