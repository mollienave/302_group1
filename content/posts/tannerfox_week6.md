This week I found and used resources for self directed learning because I have been watching videos in my spare time outside of class on how to use wordpress effiecently and i have learned some cool tricks on how to navigate around the site a lot eaiser. I am also researching methods so that i can incorporate the use of cookies onto out wordpress site, from what i have read cookies are already incorporated into wordpress so their is no need for an extra plugin but to be in complaince with privacy policies there is a plugin for cookie compliance where it informs the user that cookies are being used on the site.
