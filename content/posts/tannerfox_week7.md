This week i was able to describe and compare content management systems through the work on our wordpress site, we were going through all of the themes that wordress has and trying to find one that would fit our page appropriately, we also were working to figure out how we wanted our pages to be set up and what content we wanted on them. I want to be able to create a search feature on our webstie so that the users can search for what kind of music they want to listen to.
