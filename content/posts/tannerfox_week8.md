This week i was able to manage content using established workflows by adding in a page to our group wordpress site, the page that i added was for the suggested music section that we are going to have, i thought that a table view would be best to keep the music organized and all togther. Once we are able to get some of the music on to the site there are sections for the names of the Artist, Album, Song, and date that the song was released. I also want to figure out a way for this section to be auto generated every week based on what is most listened to on our site.
