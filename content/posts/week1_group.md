This week as a group we were able to establish accounts for Hugo and Github and link the two together. Mollie was able to finish the linking process and create the first personal post onto our Hugo website. We were able to link up in communication through Groupme and Microsoft Teams to discuss the content that we want on our wordpress website, which we have not finalized a topic yet but have a couple options we are deciding over such as a spotify type website since one of our group members makes music. We were also able to help eachother navigate Github to get our personal posts successfully onto this website.
