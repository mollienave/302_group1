Edit: I think my personal contract still works.
A: Does required tasks. Pitches ideas. Edits pages. Helps group member. On time. Shows up to class. Communicates well.
B: Does all of what’s required in A but might not communicate as well and misses a few classes and doesn’t edit pages or give input on other group members work that much.
C: Required tasks not done well. Late sometimes. Communication is lacking. Doesn’t reply much. Not many ideas given. 
D: Does barely anything. Doesn’t communicate. Tasks aren’t finished. 
E: Doesn’t anything nor shows up.
