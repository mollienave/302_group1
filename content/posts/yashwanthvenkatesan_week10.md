This week I emplyed technologies related to content management by using cover images to set as icons for our store site and made the texts as links. I used self directed 
learning to find out how to get SVG icons the orignal daybreak website had. I found them on font awesome. I realised that if I uploaded them directly to WordPress 
they weren't the same color so I needed to learn how to edit them. I found two ways to edit them. First was to use visual studio to change the fill color. When I did that 
I got a permission error. I found a second way to change color by using a program called inkscape. I fille dit to the correct CSS color and got all the necessary icons uploaded
to WordPress.
