I learned about key concepts which music streaming sites would have. I found out that there is alot of requirements which would make the site professional and functional. I found
articles which helped me add ideas into what our group could call an A worthy website. How optimize, organize and make sure the site does what it's intended to do. I learned about
plugins which can help our group with allowing specific functions for out website. How to add a music player, aloowing payments to process on the site and making a log in.
