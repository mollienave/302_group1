This week I established work flows by deciding with my group members what roles each person would like to do. We talked about what our strengths were and what we preferred doing based
on what our skillsets are. We also set tasks on microsoft teams for what each role should complete for the website to be finished. I found resources for self directed learning by 
searching up what are some tasks and roles that are needed to run a website. Based on what I read online I added to our contract.
