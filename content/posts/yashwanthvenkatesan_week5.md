This week I compared content management systems by using the inspect elemtn button on chrome to look throught the daybreak website to pull images from their site. 
They were stored in a folder compared and they were put onto the site using html and CSS. Wordpress can do the same thing but the process is a lot simpler. On Friday I indentified a
limitations with the wordpress website when trying to upload an imiage over the max cpacity. So I searched on google how to decrease the file size and learned that I would have a significant 
quality reduction if I tried to make it any smaller. I explored more of wordpress this week and am getting familar with how to operate it.
