This week I was exploring more tools and settings of WordPress. I was able to figure out how to add media to a page, layout a page, and work with plug ins. I finally got Wamp server
to work on my laptop. I had Watched videos and looked at online forums to figure out how to fix my problems. I set up my wordpress and considered possible themes that could look well 
for my team's website.
