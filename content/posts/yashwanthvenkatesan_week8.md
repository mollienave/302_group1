This week I employed technologies related to content management when I worked on the group workdpress site. I figured out how to choose a theme, and I found a plug in to add to our music site. it has many features which can utilize and makes
building the site seem a lot simpler. I also used self-directed learning. I wanted to add animations and add a design around the form. So I learned how to add CSS to the daybreak dummy page. It allows me to get a closer 1:1 look of the original web page.
