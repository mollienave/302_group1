This week I found resources online to help me learn CSS. I found out how to add gradient backgrounds and add animations to images when hovering a mouse over it.
I think I could've done better by looking more into the WordPress settings. i found that there was a simpler way to add background colors. I emplyed technologies releated to
content management by figuring out how to get the specific CSS hex code for colors on a website by using the inspect and clicking on a color in the console then clicking on the
color I want to find te code for.
