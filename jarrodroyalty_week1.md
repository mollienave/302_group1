As a group this week we learned how to set up Hugo and GitHub and link the two together. Mollie was able to link the two and start the process for us to create our personal posts onto our Hugo website. We were able to link up in communication through groupme and Microsoft teams to discuss the content we want on our Wordpress website and work on these group reports together.
